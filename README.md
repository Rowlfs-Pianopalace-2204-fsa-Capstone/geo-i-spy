Pitch:
Our app is designed to gamify and encourage getting outside, building mindfulness and discovering more of the area around you., such as catching the smaller details, diving into landmarks or finding hidden gems

We’re populating it with a list of landmarks spread throughout the map for you to find along with unfamiliar places, to help enrich your view of your area like the two waterfall parks in manhattan that you’ve probably never visited before. We’re hoping that through this app, you’ll find your next favorite hangout or date spot.

At the forefront of our app, we’ll introduce a list of elements to look out for, everyday objects like fire hydrants, that we’ll ask a picture of, getting our users to take a more thorough look at their area
